[Paxo](https://paxo.ai) is a consumer app that records voice recordings — typically meetings — and turns them into organized, detailed notes.

We do speaker identification, transcript generation, and Markdown notes. I built Paxo with [Rhythm Garg](https://rhythmgarg.com).

We launched Paxo in March 2023. In June, we sold the business. I learned a lot.
