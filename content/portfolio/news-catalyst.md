In the fall of 2019, I worked at [News Catalyst](https://newscatalyst.org/), building digital tools to empower local news organizations. My work at News Catalyst was supported by the [Lenfest Institute](https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/).

- Created [OpenAlerts](https://github.com/news-catalyst/openalerts), a fully-featured and open source breaking news distribution system intended for local newsrooms. (Because OpenAlerts is open source, I remain on the project. See the *Projects* section.)
- Worked with [Tyler Fisher](https://tylerjfisher.com/) to create a management system for the [American Press Institute](https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/)'s "Table Stakes" program.
- Helped build the technical foundation of [PressPass](https://github.com/news-catalyst/presspass-frontend), News Catalyst's primary offering, and contributed to MuckRock's [Squarelet](https://github.com/MuckRock/squarelet/).
