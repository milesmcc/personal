[Atlos](https://atlos.org) is a platform for open source visual investigations. It helps journalists, human rights organizations, and OSINT investigators collaborate at scale. Atlos is supported by [National Geographic](https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2023/05/02/introducing-the-national-geographic-societys-2023-young-explorers/), the [Brown Institute](https://brown.stanford.edu), and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/democracy-forward?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr5).

Atlos isn't just a prototype: It already powers [Bellingcat's](https://bellingcat.com) pioneering investigatory work in [Ukraine](https://ukraine.bellingcat.com), through their Global Authentication Project.

Giancarlo Fiorella, an investigator at Bellingcat, called Atlos a "game changer."
