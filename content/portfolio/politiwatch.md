[Politiwatch](https://politiwatch.org) is a non-profit that technology to promote political accountability, digital rights, and social awareness. I founded Politiwatch as a way to distance myself from some of my more [controversial projects](https://polititweet.org). (They weren't *that* controversial, but I didn't feel comfortable putting my name on them.)

If you find the work I do as Politiwatch impactful, please consider [donating](https://donorbox.org/whoaremyrepresentatives).

Politiwatch's sponsors include Google (via their Google for Nonprofits program), Microsoft (though their nonprofit grants program), ProtonMail, and DigitalOcean.
