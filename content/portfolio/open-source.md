Most of the software I write is open source. In maintaining and contributing to these projects, I've learned about effective community building, communication, and documentation.

Here are some of the open source projects I maintain:

* [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet)
* [a17t](https://github.com/milesmcc/a17t)
* [Atlos](https://github.com/atlosdotorg/atlos)
