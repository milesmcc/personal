## Origins of Oversight

In this research project, [Dr. Sarah Kreps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kreps) and I processed the entire modern congressional record to study the determinants of foreign policy oversight in Congress. Co-authored with Dr. Kreps. The source code for much of the project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/milesmcc/CongressionalDroneOversight).

- Presented by Dr. Kreps at Yale, Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown, and UC Santa Barbara.
- Co-authored popular opinion piece in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/24/congress-keeps-quiet-on-u-s-drone-policy-and-thats-a-big-problem/).

## Perceptions of Privacy in the COVID-19 Pandemic

In this paper, [Dr. Baobao Zhang](https://baobaofzhang.github.io/), [Dr. Sarah Kreps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kreps), [Nina McMurry](https://polisci.mit.edu/people/nina-mcmurry), and I explored public perceptions of privacy towards COVID-19 contact tracing apps. I don't want to overstate my involvement, though—I only contributed some additional framing, prose, and final touches to the project.
