Starting in the spring of 2019, I worked on the technology subgroup of a major U.S. presidential campaign (mostly working on matters of cyber policy). I worked with the team to draft policy positions, and wrote weekly cyber policy briefings for the candidate.

I signed an NDA with the campaign and don't want to reveal much more about this work online, but I can _assure_ you that the candidate I worked for was _not_ Donald Trump.
