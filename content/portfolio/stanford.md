From September 2020 to June 2024, I was an undergraduate at [Stanford](https://stanford.edu). I majored in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu) with an individually designed concentration in _Digital Safety, Security, and Society_.

### Honors and Awards

* **J. E. Wallace Sterling Award for Academic Achievement** for being among the top 25 graduating seniors in the school of Arts and Sciences
* **Phi Beta Kappa** as a junior year inductee
* Graduated with **Distinction**, Stanford's top academic honor (that I'm aware of, at least)

I'm also one class away from my Master's in Computer Science. We'll see if I ever get that degree.

### Work
* **RA at the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu)** (October 2020 – June 2024). Worked on the Tech Team and with the [Election Integrity Partnership](https://www.eipartnership.net/). Studied Wikipedia in a series of two blog posts ([part 1](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/wikipedia-part-one), [part 2](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/wikipedia-part-two)). Built [GoGettr](https://github.com/stanfordio/gogettr). Quoted in [TIME magazine](https://time.com/5930061/wikipedia-birthday/), with research mentioned in many more outlets. Built out the core data analysis and ingest tooling.

* **CS 106S Team** (January 2020 – June 2024). Helped taught [CS 106S](cs106s.stanford.edu), a supplemental 1-unit add-on to Stanford's famous CS intro class (CS 106A) focusing on programming for social good.
