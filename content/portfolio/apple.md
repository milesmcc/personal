During the summer of 2022, I worked on [privacy at Apple](https://www.apple.com/privacy/), as part of the Privacy Engineering team. It was an amazing experience.

The Privacy Engineering team works with all across Apple to make sure that products and services protect user privacy and safety — across all levels of the technology stack. Details of my work are unfortunately covered by an NDA.
