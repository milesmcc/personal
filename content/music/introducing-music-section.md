Welcome to the new music section of my website! Here I'll be sharing thoughts on music I'm enjoying, audio projects I'm working on, and occasional explorations into music technology and sound design.

Music has always been an important part of my life, and I'm excited to have a dedicated space to write about it. Expect posts about everything from album reviews to audio programming experiments.

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
