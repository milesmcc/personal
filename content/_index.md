I have a strong technical background and a passion for digital safety and governance. I'm especially interested in tech policy, trust & safety, cybersecurity, human-centered design, privacy engineering, OSINT, artificial intelligence, and open source software. My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several outlets including the *Washington Post*, the *New York Times*, *NBC News*, *TIME*, *Foreign Affairs*, Brookings *TechStream*, and the *Nightly News* with Lester Holt. I'm an undergraduate at Stanford.

Some of the projects I'm most proud of are [PrivacySpy](https://privacyspy.org), [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet), [PolitiTweet](https://polititweet.org), my work at the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu), and [a17t](https://a17t.miles.land). I teach [CS 106S](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106s/) at Stanford, I worked on cyber policy for a [2020 presidential campaign](/portfolio/politics), and I'm a non-resident undergraduate fellow at the Cornell [Tech Policy Lab](https://tpl.as.cornell.edu). I'm an alum of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=e62336f0f378bcf03a96d441d015db88).

And finally, for the obligatory apostrophe soup: PA &rsquo;19, [RC S1 &rsquo;20](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=e62336f0f378bcf03a96d441d015db88), [Stanford &rsquo;24](https://stanford.edu/~mccain/), EOT. More details are in my [portfolio](/portfolio/).
