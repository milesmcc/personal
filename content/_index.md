I want to make the world more secure, transparent, and safe.

### Currently

- I'm a Member of Technical Staff at [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com). 
- I support human rights investigations at scale via [Atlos](https://atlos.org). My work is made possible by [National Geographic](https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2023/05/02/introducing-the-national-geographic-societys-2023-young-explorers/), the [Brown Institute at Stanford](https://brown.stanford.edu), and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/democracy-forward?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr5).
- I [maintain](https://github.com/milesmcc) a number of open source projects, including [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet) and [a17t](https://github.com/milesmcc/a17t).

### Previously

I worked on election security at [CISA/DHS](https://cisa.gov), privacy engineering at [Apple](/portfolio/apple), trust and safety at the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu), AI policy in [collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09203) with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/research/gpt-2-6-month-follow-up) and the [Cornell Tech Policy Institute](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/btpi/), and digital infrastructure with some [newsrooms](https://newscatalyst.org/).

At [Stanford](/portfolio/stanford), I taught [CS 106S](https://cs106s.stanford.edu) (Coding for Social Good) and I co-directed the [Stanford Security Clinic](https://securityclinic.org). I'm an alum of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=e62336f0f378bcf03a96d441d015db88), I had an [app](https://paxo.ai) (but [we](https://rhythmgarg.com) sold the business), and I worked on cyber policy for a [2020 presidential campaign](/portfolio/politics).

### Broadly

My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several outlets including the _New York Times_, the _Washington Post_, _NBC News_, _TIME_, _Foreign Affairs_, Brookings _TechStream_, _Lawfare_, the _Nightly News_ with Lester Holt, and elsewhere. I've also [spoken](/portfolio/speaking) at a few conferences, including [DEF CON](/posts/classmates-legal-threat-fizz-defcon/), [TSRC](https://conferences.law.stanford.edu/tsrc/), and [RightsCon](https://twitter.com/bellingcat/status/1668644662976888832).
