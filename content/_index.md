I want to make the world more secure, transparent, and safe. I'm a student at Stanford, where I study Symbolic Systems and Computer Science.

### Currently

- I support human rights investigations at scale via [Atlos](https://atlos.org). My work is made possible by [National Geographic](https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2023/05/02/introducing-the-national-geographic-societys-2023-young-explorers/), the [Brown Institute](https://brown.stanford.edu), and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/democracy-forward?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr5).
- I [maintain](https://github.com/milesmcc) a number of open source projects, including [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet) and [a17t](https://github.com/milesmcc/a17t).
- At Stanford, I teach [CS 106S](https://cs106s.stanford.edu) (Coding for Social Good), I research trust & safety at the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu), and I co-direct the [Stanford Security Clinic](https://securityclinic.org).

### Previously

I worked on election security at [CISA/DHS](https://cisa.gov), privacy engineering at [Apple](/portfolio/apple), trust and safety at the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu), AI policy in [collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09203) with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/research/gpt-2-6-month-follow-up) and the [Cornell Tech Policy Institute](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/btpi/), and digital infrastructure with some [newsrooms](https://newscatalyst.org/).

I'm an alum of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=e62336f0f378bcf03a96d441d015db88), I had an [app](https://paxo.ai) (but [we](https://rhythmgarg.com) sold the business), I worked on cyber policy for a [2020 presidential campaign](/portfolio/politics), and I co-authored some [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lrKeJiUAAAAJ).

### Broadly

My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several outlets including the _New York Times_, the _Washington Post_, _NBC News_, _TIME_, _Foreign Affairs_, Brookings _TechStream_, the _Nightly News_ with Lester Holt, and elsewhere. I've also spoken at a few conferences, including [DEF CON](/posts/classmates-legal-threat-fizz-defcon/) and [RightsCon](https://twitter.com/bellingcat/status/1668644662976888832).
